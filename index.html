      <p class="adoption-description">
        <em>Pet adoption</em> is the process of transferring responsibility for
        a pet that was previously owned by another party such as a person,
        shelter, or rescue organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are
        animal shelters and rescue groups. Some organizations give adopters
        ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the
        organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care.

        He was born in June 2019 under my parent's house. My family used to feed
        his mom, who gave birth to 5 kittens. We were able to give 3 in
        adoption, but Tigrito and his sister, Negrita, were not adopted. Negrita
        is a very independent and outgoing cat, she loves to hunt and the
        freedom of living outside. Tigrito was the total opposite. He loved to
        be with us and he was very comfortable inside the house. We found out my
        stepdad was allergic to cats, so Tigrito was not allowed to enter the
        house anymore. Eventually, when I moved out, I brought him with me. Now
        he is 6 years old.

        My husband's family found him wandering around the neighborhood after
        Hurricane Matthew hit Miami in 2016. They tried to find the owners, but
        no one claimed him. The family got attached to his sweet personality,
        especially my husband, and they decided to adopt him. Eventually, when
        my husband and I got married, we decided to bring Itto with us. He is
        currently 12 years old.
